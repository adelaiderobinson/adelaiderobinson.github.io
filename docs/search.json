I then divided the total area of overlap by the total watershed area and multiplied by 100 to find the % protected. I removed any protected areas established after 1981, as this was the first year of data available."

    "text": "General\nAfter finding percent protected for each watershed, I added this as a column in the population count data. I selected only for adult population counts, as these were the most consistent metric of salmon population data collected. For years when adult populations were estimated using more than one method for the same population, I took the average of the estimates. I also removed populations which never had any fish observed during the time period of my analysis. For ease of interpretation, I set the first year with observations as year 0 (1981 for steelhead and 1995 for coho)."

I have primarily focused on monitoring salmon populations, although I have experience with everything from bird surveys to restoration. As a fisheries technician at Point Reyes National Seashore, I led a Dual Frequency Identification (DIDSON) sonar camera project designed to monitor adult salmon. My duties included managing all data concerning nearly 3,000 hours of sonar footage. This project, along with my experience collecting data in the field, piqued my interest in delving deeper into data management and analysis."
